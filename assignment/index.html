<ul>
    <li>I have a dog named Aldo. Aldo likes to sing with music. He listens and gets louder with loud parts and quieter with quiet parts. He has favorite songs.</li>
    <li>Maruchan is the best instant ramen brand. I would rather not have ramen than eat non-Maruchan ramen. Ok not really but there will be a lingering taste of resentment.</li>
    <li>For the past couple years I have averaged reading about one book per month. Recently I realized that if I live another 40 years (knock on wood), that's only 480 more books. Sorry, maybe that's not a fun fact, but I would like more time to read more books. Maybe I should train to speed-read, if that's a thing that could be enjoyable.</li>
